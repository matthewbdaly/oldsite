I’ve found that, when compared to PHP or Perl, at least for me, it’s a lot easier to “get into the zone” when programming in Python, the code I produce tends to be a lot more readable and easier to follow, and the interactive interpreter makes it really easy to figure out what’s going on in a way that just isn’t possible with PHP or Perl. Also, Python was always designed to be an object-oriented language, and IMHO has a better object model than either Perl or PHP.</p><p>While it would be fair to say that Python doesn’t have a single web development framework that monopolises developer’s attention the way Rails does for Ruby programmers, Django is undoubtedly the best-known Python framework. It’s solid, easy to use, and has the best documentation of any web development framework I’ve ever seen (don’t get me wrong, CodeIgniter in particular has very good documentation, but Django’s is exceptional).</p><p>In this tutorial, we’re going to build a very simple blogging engine using Django. In its initial stages, it will be an extremely simple web app - we won’t bother with comments, tags, categories or multiple users , or any of the other niceties of a fully-fledged blogging engine. Instead, we will build a very basic Tumblr-style blogging engine, capable of publishing blog posts and very little else. As time goes by, we can add further functionality to this and build it up into a more capable blogging solution.</p><p>So, let’s get started. Go to the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django project website</a> and download the latest release (NOTE: as at time of writing this was 1.3.1, but we’re now up to 1.4.3 as at 14 January 2013, and some changes have been made to Django’s structure). Follow the installation instructions given there, and you should be ready to go. Note that from here on, I’m assuming you’re using a Unix-like operating system such as a Linux distro or Mac OS X - if you’re using Windows, there’s a few extra steps you’ll have to take, such as installing Python, and some of the commands you use may be different.</p><p>Once Django is installed, find a suitable folder in which to store your new Django project (perhaps a Projects folder in your home directory might be a good place). Note that Django includes its own development server, so you don’t need to install a full LAMP stack like you would if you were developing in PHP. Then, from the folder you want to store your project in, run the following command:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-bash singleline"><table>django-admin.py startproject DjangoB<span class="hljs-built_in">log</span></table></code></pre><p>This will create a brand-new directory containing all the files you need for your new Django project. If you now cd into this directory, you should see manage.py, as well as a folder called DjangoBlog containing the files <code>__init__.py</code>, <code>settings.py</code> and <code>urls.py</code>.</p><p>Let’s go through what these files do. First of all, there’s <strong>init</strong>.py - don’t worry about this, it’s a blank file and you don’t need to touch it.</p><p>Next, manage.py contains a number of extremely useful commands that you will find handy when using Django. You’re unlikely to need to edit it, but you’ll use it a lot.</p><p>Next, settings.py is the settings for the web app you’re building. It will specify details like what Django applications you’re using, what timezone you’re in, your database connection details and so on. You’ll need to edit this, so open it up in your favourite text editor.</p><p>Look for a line that reads “DATABASES”. Under here you’ll notice the following line:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-python singleline"><table>      <span class="hljs-string">'ENGINE'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'django.db.backends.'</span>, <span class="hljs-comment"># Add 'postgresql_psycopg2',     'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.</span></table></code></pre><p>You can use pretty much any relational database you like with Django, and because it uses its own Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), it generates the SQL needed for you, taking into account any quirks in that particular database engine. It therefore doesn’t really matter what database you use, and it’s easy to swap them out. For development purposes, we’ll use SQLite as it ships with Python and requires less configuration, so change this line to read as follows:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-python singleline"><table>      <span class="hljs-string">'ENGINE'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'django.db.backends.sqlite3'</span>, <span class="hljs-comment"># Add 'postgresql_psycopg2',     'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.</span></table></code></pre><p>Next you’ll see this line:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-python singleline"><table>      <span class="hljs-string">'NAME'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">''</span>,                      <span class="hljs-comment"># Or path to database file if using sqlite3.</span></table></code></pre><p>It really doesn’t matter what you call the file. I tend to call mine backend.db, as follows:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-python singleline"><table>        <span class="hljs-string">'NAME'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'backend.db'</span>,                      <span class="hljs-comment"># Or path to database file if using sqlite3.</span></table></code></pre><p>If you keep going down, you’ll notice TIME_ZONE and LANGUAGE_CODE. You may wish to change these from their default settings (I change mine to Europe/London for TIME_ZONE and en-gb for LANGUAGE_CODE).</p><p>Even further down, you’ll notice the INSTALLED_APPS section. Django distinguishes between a project and an application - while a project will normally be a single website, an application will be a set of functionality within that website. For instance, our blog will be a single application, but we could reuse that application on multiple projects. Django also includes a number of applications out of the box - for instance, the flatpages and admin applications can be used together if you wanted to use Django to build a simple CMS, without having to build a new application at all.</p><p>For now, we don’t need to add any new applications, so let’s save the changes we’ve made to settings.py and move on to urls.py. This handles directing any incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate place to deal with them. It uses simple regular expressions to evaluate the incoming requests, and maps them to specific view functions. Note that it already includes URLs for the admin functionality, but these are commented out by default.</p><p>Exit urls.py and head back to the main directory for your project. Now, we need to test that everything works OK. Run the following command:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-bash singleline"><table>python manage.py runserver</table></code></pre><p>Remember I said that the manage.py script had a lot of useful functions? This is one of them. Django has its own simple web server so you don’t have to faff around setting up Apache just for development purposes, and this launches it. If you go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a>, you should see a screen telling you that Django is running.</p><p>Now, you can stop the server for now using <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd>, and we’ll start work on your new app. Run the following command to create your new app:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-bash singleline"><table>python manage.py startapp blogengine</table></code></pre><p>Again, note that you used manage.py to do this. There should now be a directory called blogengine in your project. Move into it, and you should find that it contains four files - <strong>init</strong>.py, models.py, tests.py and views.py. Again, <strong>init</strong>.py can be safely ignored, and tests.py can also be left alone, but models.py and views.py deserve closer examination.</p><p>If you haven’t used an MVC framework before, then you’ll need this explaining. MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, and it describes a method of logically separating out code for a web application to make it easier to work with. Models represent the data held by the application, views represent what end-users see of the application, and controllers represent the logic that ties the two together.</p><p>Django uses a slightly unusual interpretation of MVC. The models work exactly the same as they do in other frameworks, but the logic is handled by the view, and the presentation is handled by templates. Compared to more conventional MVC frameworks such as CodeIgniter, Django’s views are more like controllers, and its templates are more like views. Django is therefore often described as an MTV framework (Model-Template-View), instead of an MVC one.</p><p>So, to create our blog, we first need to create a model to describe the data. Edit models.py so it looks like the following:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-python"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> django.db <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> models</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td><span class="hljs-comment"># Create your models here.</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="4"></td><td><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Post</span><span class="hljs-params">(models.Model)</span>:</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="5"></td><td>    title = models.CharField(max_length=<span class="hljs-number">200</span>)</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="6"></td><td>    pub_date = models.DateTimeField()</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="7"></td><td>    text = models.TextField()</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="8"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="9"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">__unicode__</span><span class="hljs-params">(self)</span>:</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="10"></td><td>        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> self.title</td></tr></table></code></pre><p>To activate our new app, we also need to include it under INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-python singleline"><table>    <span class="hljs-string">'blogengine'</span>,</table></code></pre><p>In Django, you create your models as Python classes, which makes it very easy to grasp. Here, a blog post is an object, and it has a title, a publication date, and some text. Note that Post here inherits from models.Model, and has specific types of field that map to field types in the database table. For instance, models.CharField obviously maps to a VARCHAR field in the database, and TextField maps to a TEXT field. You can actually see the SQL that will generate the database table for this model by returning to the project’s main directory and running python manage.py sqlall blogengine:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-sql"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">BEGIN</span>;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td><span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">CREATE</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">TABLE</span> <span class="hljs-string">"blogengine_post"</span> (</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-string">"id"</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">integer</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">PRIMARY</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">KEY</span>,</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="4"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-string">"title"</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">varchar</span>(<span class="hljs-number">200</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>,</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="5"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-string">"pub_date"</span> datetime <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>,</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="6"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-string">"text"</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">text</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="7"></td><td>)</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="8"></td><td>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="9"></td><td><span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">COMMIT</span>;</span></td></tr></table></code></pre><p>Note the “id” field. You didn’t add this - by default, Django will create an id field in any new table, and will make this the primary key in that database table. You can, however, override this behaviour if you wish. Here it’s exactly what we want so we’ll stick with it for now.</p><p>Also note the <strong>unicode</strong> method. This represents a string that describes that object. Here the title of a blog post seems the most logical way of describing it, so we return the object’s title.</p><p>Now that we’ve got our model set up, how do we get the information into it? For a blog post, all of the information will be submitted by the user, so we need to set up some kind of administrative interface. Fortunately, one of Django’s killer features is the admin interface that ships with it. This makes it really quick and easy to get certain kinds of sites up and running.</p><p>First of all, we need to activate the admin application. Head up to settings.py and uncomment the line that reads:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-python singleline"><table>    <span class="hljs-string">'django.contrib.admin'</span>,</table></code></pre><p>Save it, then head for urls.py and uncomment the following lines:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-python"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-comment"># from django.contrib import admin</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td><span class="hljs-comment"># admin.autodiscover()</span></td></tr></table></code></pre><p>And:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-python singleline"><table>   <span class="hljs-comment"># url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),</span></table></code></pre><p>Now, in order for the admin interface to be able to set up new blog posts, you need to also register it. In the blogengine directory containing your app, create a new file called admin.py, and fill it out with the following code:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-python"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> models</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> django.contrib <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> admin</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="4"></td><td>admin.site.register(models.Post)</td></tr></table></code></pre><p>Once that’s done, return to the project directory and run this command to create the database tables you need:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-bash singleline"><table>python manage.py syncdb</table></code></pre><p>You’ll get asked for some information to set up your user account - remember it as you’ll need it to log into the admin interface. Once that’s done, run python manage.py runserver again, and return to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a> again. You should be confronted with a 404 page - that’s fine, that’s exactly what we should be seeing. You’ll note that the message states that Django tried the ^admin/ path without success - what this means is that this is the only URL pattern in urls.py at the moment, and the path you entered didn’t match this.</p><p>If you change the URL in the browser to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin">http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin</a>, you should get a login screen. Enter the username and password you set when you ran syncdb and click Log in. You should now see Django’s admin interface, with Posts available, and an Add and Change dialogue visible next to it. If you want to add a few blog posts, just to have some data to work with, go ahead. Note that for the Date and Time dialogues, Django automatically adds the Today and Now shortcuts.</p><p>So, our model is now sorted and we have some data in the web app. The next step is to write our views. You’ll notice that the blogengine app contains a file called views.py - open this up and enter the following code:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-python"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-comment"># Create your views here.</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> django.shortcuts <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> render_to_response</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> blogengine.models <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Post</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="4"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="5"></td><td><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">getRecentPosts</span><span class="hljs-params">(request)</span>:</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="6"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-comment"># Get all blog posts</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="7"></td><td>    posts = Post.objects.all()</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="8"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="9"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-comment"># Sort posts into chronological order</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="10"></td><td>    sorted_posts = posts.order_by(<span class="hljs-string">'-pub_date'</span>)</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="11"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="12"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-comment"># Display all the posts</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="13"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> render_to_response(<span class="hljs-string">'posts.html'</span>, { <span class="hljs-string">'posts'</span>:sorted_posts})</td></tr></table></code></pre><p>Let’s go through this code. The first line imports the render_to_response method, which is used to render a template. The second line imports the Post model.</p><p>Next, we define the getRecentPosts view. For simplicity’s sake, we aren’t going to bother about pagination for the moment, so we’ll just get all the posts. The view is written as a Python function, and we pass it the request object as the sole parameter.</p><p>Next, we get all of the Post objects, using Post.objects.all(), and assign it to a list called posts. As we want these to be in reverse chronological order, we then reorder them by pub_date (note the - sign at the beginning to denote reverse order) and assign the result to sorted_posts. Finally, we load the posts.html template and pass through sorted_posts as the value in a dictionary called posts.</p><p>With our view done, we now need to produce a template for it. Head back up to your main project directory and create a new folder called templates. Then, go into settings.py and find the line marked TEMPLATE_DIRS. Inside the brackets, underneath the comments, add the full, absolute path to the new templates folder, as in this example:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-bash singleline"><table>  <span class="hljs-string">"/Users/matthewdaly/Development/Python/Django/blog/templates"</span></table></code></pre><p>You’ll have to change this to the full, absolute path on your machine. This will tell Django to look for the templates in that folder. Now, go into templates, and create a new file called posts.html. Enter the following text into it:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-django"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">html</span>&gt;</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">head</span>&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td>        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">title</span>&gt;</span>My Django Blog<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">title</span>&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="4"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">head</span>&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="5"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">body</span>&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="6"></td><td>        <span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> post <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> posts %}</span><span class="xml"></span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="7"></td><td>        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">h1</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-variable">{{ post.title }}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">h1</span>&gt;</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="8"></td><td>        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">h3</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-variable">{{ post.pub_date }}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">h3</span>&gt;</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="9"></td><td>        <span class="hljs-variable">{{ post.text }}</span><span class="xml"></span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="10"></td><td>        <span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">endfor</span> %}</span><span class="xml"></span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="11"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">body</span>&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="12"></td><td><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">html</span>&gt;</span></td></tr></table></code></pre><p>Most of this is just plain old HTML, but you’ll notice that {% %} denotes tags that can include some logic (such as a for loop in this case), and {{ }} denotes a variable. Remember that in the view we passed through a dictionary containing all of the Post objects, and here we’re iterating through all of those post objects, outputting their title, publication date and text content.</p><p>With this done, we need to configure the routes to call the getRecentPosts view when someone visits the home page. Open urls.py again and add the following code underneath where you enabled the admin, but still inside the parentheses:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-python"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-comment"># Home page</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td>    url(<span class="hljs-string">r''</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'blogengine.views.getRecentPosts'</span>),</td></tr></table></code></pre><p>Now, this is a very simple regular expression. Here, this is our default page, so we leave the single quotes after the r empty. We then specify that this URL should be handled by the getRecentPosts function, inside views.py, in the blogengine application.</p><p>Save that, and start up the development server again with python manage.py runserver. Then, if you haven’t already added a few test posts, do so via the admin interface. Then open <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a>, and you should see your blog posts.</p><p>So, we now have the beginnings of a blogging application! We’ll leave it here for now, and will go on to add functionality like viewing individual posts and pagination later. We’ll also look into adding further functionality to our blog, such as supporting multiple authors, tagging posts, and adding flat pages.</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">29th January 2012 7:52 pm</p><h1><a href="/blog/2012/01/29/so-you-really-dont-know-regular-expressions/">So You REALLY Don&#x27;t Know Regular Expressions?</a></h1><p>Ever since I started my new job, I’ve noticed a curious phenomenon. I work with two wonderfully gifted programmers who both know PHP much better than I do, and I learn something new from them all the time. However, neither one of them really knows or uses regular expressions.</p><p>Now, as I learned Perl before I learned PHP, naturally I learned regular expressions quite early on in that process. In Perl, regular expressions are a huge part of the language - you simply cannot get away without learning them to some extent as they are used extensively in so many parts of the language.</p><p>Apparently I’m not the only one to notice this. Here’s a quote I found on Stack Exchange:</p><blockquote><p>In earlier phases of my career (ie. pre-PHP), I was a Perl guru, and one major aspect of Perl gurudom is mastery of regular expressions.</p><p>On my current team, I’m literally the only one of us who reaches for regex before other (usually nastier) tools. Seems like to the rest of the team they’re pure magic. They’ll wheel over to my desk and ask for a regex that takes me literally ten seconds to put together, and then be blown away when it works. I don’t know—I’ve worked with them so long, it’s just natural at this point.</p><p>In the absence of regex-fluency, you’re left with combinations of flow-control statements wrapping strstr and strpos statements, which gets ugly and hard to run in your head. I’d much rather craft one elegant regex than thirty lines of plodding string searching.</p></blockquote><p>While I would hesitate to call myself a Perl guru (at best I would call myself intermediate with Perl), I would say I know enough about regular expressions that I can generally get useful work done with them.</p><p>Take the following example in Perl (edited somewhat as it didn’t play nice with TinyMCE):</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-perl"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-variable">$fruit</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"apple,banana,cherry"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">print</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$fruit</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td><span class="hljs-variable">@fruit</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">split</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/,/</span>,<span class="hljs-variable">$fruit</span>);</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="4"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">foreach</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">@fruit</span>)</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="5"></td><td>{</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="6"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-keyword">print</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$_</span>.<span class="hljs-string">"\n"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="7"></td><td>}</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="8"></td><td>apple,banana,cherry</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="9"></td><td>apple</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="10"></td><td>banana</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="11"></td><td>cherry</td></tr></table></code></pre><p>Now, this code should be fairly easy to understand, even if you don’t really know Perl. $fruit is a string containing “apple,banana,cherry”. The split() function takes two arguments, a regular expression defining the character(s) that are used to separate the parts of the string you want to put into an array, and the string you want to split. This returns the array @fruit, which consists of three strings, “apple’, “banana”, and “cherry”.</p><p>In PHP, you can do pretty much the same thing, using the explode() function:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-php"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-preprocessor">&lt;?php</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td><span class="hljs-variable">$fruit</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"apple,banana,cherry"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$fruit</span>.<span class="hljs-string">"\n"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="4"></td><td><span class="hljs-variable">$fruitArray</span> = explode(<span class="hljs-string">","</span>,<span class="hljs-variable">$fruit</span>);</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="5"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">foreach</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$fruitArray</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$fruitArrayItem</span>)</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="6"></td><td>{</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="7"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$fruitArrayItem</span>.<span class="hljs-string">"\n"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="8"></td><td>}</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="9"></td><td><span class="hljs-preprocessor">?&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="10"></td><td>apple,banana,cherry</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="11"></td><td>apple</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="12"></td><td>banana</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="13"></td><td>cherry</td></tr></table></code></pre><p>As you can see, they work in pretty much the same way here. Both return basically the same output, and the syntax for using the appropriate functions for splitting the strings is virtually identical.</p><p>However, it’s once things get a bit more difficult that it becomes obvious how much more powerful regular expressions are. Say you’re dealing with a string that’s similar to that above, but may use different characters to separate the elements. For instance, say you’ve obtained the data that you want to pass through into an array from a text file and it’s somewhat inconsistent - perhaps the information you want is separated by differing amounts and types of whitespace, or different characters. The explode() function simply won’t handle that (at least, not without a lot of pain). But with Perl’s split() function, that’s no problem. Here’s how you might deal with input that had different types and quantities of whitespace as a separator:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-perl singleline"><table><span class="hljs-variable">@fruit</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">split</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/\s+/</span>,<span class="hljs-variable">$fruit</span>);</table></code></pre><p>Yes, it’s that simple! The \s metacharacter matches any type of whitespace, and the + modifier means that it will match one or more times. Now you can very easily convert the contents of that string into an array.</p><p>Or say you want to convert an entire string of text, with all kinds of punctuation and whitespace, into an array, but only keep the actual words. This wouldn’t be practical with explode(), but with split() it’s easy:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-perl singleline"><table><span class="hljs-variable">@fruit</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">split</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/\W+/</span>,<span class="hljs-variable">$fruit</span>);</table></code></pre><p>The \W metacharacter matches any non-word character (ie anything other than a-z, A-Z or 0-9), and again the + modifier means that it will match one or more times.</p><p>And of course, regular expressions are useful for many more tasks than this that, while possible with most language’s existing string functions, can get very nasty quite quickly. Say you want to match a UK postcode to check that it’s valid (note that for the sake of simplicity, I’m going to ignore BFPO and GIR postcodes). These use a format of one or two letters, followed by one digit, then may have an additional digit or letter, then a space, then a digit, then two letters. This would be a nightmare to check using most language’s native string functions, but with a regex in Perl, it’s relatively simple:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-perl"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$postcode</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"NR1 1NP"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$postcode</span> =~ <span class="hljs-regexp">m/^[a-zA-Z]{1,2}\d{1}(|[a-zA-Z0-9]{1})(|\s+)\d{1}\w{2}$/</span>)</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td>{</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="4"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-keyword">print</span> <span class="hljs-string">"It matched!\n"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="5"></td><td>}</td></tr></table></code></pre><p>And if you wanted to return the first part of the postcode if it matched as well, that’s simple too:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-perl"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$postcode</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"NR1 1NP"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$postcode</span> =~ <span class="hljs-regexp">s/^([a-zA-Z]{1,2}\d{1}(|[a-zA-Z0-9]{1}))(|\s+)\d{1}\w{2}$/$1/</span>)</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td>{</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="4"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-keyword">print</span> <span class="hljs-string">"It matched! <span class="hljs-variable">$postcode</span>\n"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="5"></td><td>}</td></tr></table></code></pre><p>Now, you may say “But that’s in Perl! I’m using PHP!’. Well, regular expressions are an extremely powerful part of PHP that are very useful, they’re just not as central to the language as they are in Perl. PHP actually has two distinct types of regular expressions - POSIX-extended regular expressions, and Perl-compatible regular expressions (or PCRE). However, POSIX-extended regular expressions were deprecated from PHP 5.3 onwards, so it’s not really worth taking the time to learn them when PCRE will do exactly the same thing and is going to be around for the future. Furthermore, most other programming languages also support Perl-compatible regular expressions, so they’re fairly portable between languages, and once you’ve learned them in one language, you can easily use them in another. In other words, if you learn how to work with regular expressions in Perl, you can very easily transfer that knowledge to most other programming languages that support regular expressions.</p><p>In the first example given above, we can replace explode() with preg_split, and the syntax is virtually identical to split() in Perl, with the only difference being the name of the function and that the pattern to match is wrapped in double quotes:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-php"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-preprocessor">&lt;?php</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td><span class="hljs-variable">$fruit</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"apple,banana,cherry"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$fruit</span>.<span class="hljs-string">"\n"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="4"></td><td><span class="hljs-variable">$fruitArray</span> = preg_split(<span class="hljs-string">"/,/"</span>,<span class="hljs-variable">$fruit</span>);</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="5"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">foreach</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$fruitArray</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$fruitArrayItem</span>)</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="6"></td><td>{</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="7"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$fruitArrayItem</span>.<span class="hljs-string">"\n"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="8"></td><td>}</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="9"></td><td><span class="hljs-preprocessor">?&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="10"></td><td>apple,banana,cherry</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="11"></td><td>apple</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="12"></td><td>banana</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="13"></td><td>cherry</td></tr></table></code></pre><p>Along similar lines, if we want to check if a string matches a pattern, we can use preg_match(), and if we want to search and replace, we can use preg_replace(). PHP’s regular expression support is not appreciably poorer than Perl’s, even if it’s less central to the language as a whole.</p><blockquote><p>But regular expressions are slower than PHP’s string functions!</p></blockquote><p>Yes, that’s true. So it’s a mistake to use regular expressions for something that can be handled quickly and easily using string functions. For instance, if in the following string you wanted to replace the word “cow” with “sheep”:</p><blockquote><p>The cow jumped over the moon</p></blockquote><p>You could use something like this:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-php"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-preprocessor">&lt;?php</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td><span class="hljs-variable">$text</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"The cow jumped over the moon"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td><span class="hljs-variable">$text</span> = preg_replace(<span class="hljs-string">"/cow/"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"sheep"</span>,<span class="hljs-variable">$text</span>);</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="4"></td><td><span class="hljs-preprocessor">?&gt;</span></td></tr></table></code></pre><p>However, because here you are only looking to match literal characters, you don’t need to use a regular expression. Just use the following:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-php"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-preprocessor">&lt;?php</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td><span class="hljs-variable">$text</span> = str_replace(<span class="hljs-string">"cow"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"sheep"</span>,<span class="hljs-variable">$text</span>);</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td><span class="hljs-preprocessor">?&gt;</span></td></tr></table></code></pre><p>But, if you have to do some more complex pattern matching, you have to start using strpos to get the location of specific characters and returning substrings between those characters, and it gets very messy, very quickly indeed. In those cases, while I haven’t done any kind of benchmarking on it, it stands to reason that quite quickly you’ll reach a point where a regex would be faster.</p><p>However, for a number of common tasks, such as validating email addresses and URLs, there’s another way and you don’t need to resort to regular expressions, or faffing about with loads of string functions. The filter_var() function can be used for validating or sanitising email addresses and URLs, among other things, so this is worth using instead of writing a regex. If you’re using a framework such as CodeIgniter, you may have access to its native functions for validating this kind of thing, so you should use those instead.</p><blockquote><p>But regular expressions are ugly and make for less readable code!</p></blockquote><p>Not really. They seem intimidating to the newcomer, and very few people can just glance at a regex and instantly know what it does. But with regexes, you can often do complex things in far fewer lines of code than would be needed to accomplish the same thing using just PHP’s string functions. If you can do something in a line or two using string functions, it’s probably best to do that. But after that, things go downhill very quickly.</p><p>Once you learn them, regular expressions really are not that hard, and you’ll probably find enough things to use them for that you’ll get plenty of practice at them. They’re certainly more readable to anyone with even a modicum of experience using them than line after line of flow-control statements.</p><blockquote><p>But you shouldn’t be using regular expressions for parsing HTML or XML!</p></blockquote><p>Quite true. Regular expressions are the wrong tool for that. You should probably use an existing library of some kind for that.</p><blockquote><p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p></blockquote><p>Ah, yes, surely one of the most misused quotes on the web! Again, regular expressions are not the right tool for every job, and there’s a lot of tasks they get used for, and quite frankly, shouldn’t be. Most of us who know regular expressions have been known to use them for things we probably shouldn’t (I actually only just stumbled across filter_var, so I’ve done my share of validating email addresses using regexes, and I’m as guilty as anyone else of overusing them). But there’s still plenty of stuff you should use it for when what you need to do can’t be accomplished quickly and easily using string functions.</p><p>Regular expressions are not inherently evil. They’re a tool like any other. What is bad is using them for things where a simple alternative exists. However, they are still extremely useful, and there’s plenty of valid use cases for them.</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">13th January 2012 7:25 pm</p><h1><a href="/blog/2012/01/13/github/">Github</a></h1><p>To date, Subversion is the single versioning system I have the most experience with. I use it at work, and I was already somewhat familiar with it beforehand. However, with all the buzz over Git over the last few years, it’s always been tempting to explore that as an alternative.</p><p>I’ve had a Github account for over a year, but had as yet not added anything to it. However, today that changed. I’ve had a rather haphazard approch towards my .vimrc and other Vim configuration files for a while, with the result that they tend to be less than consistent across different machines. I’ve seen that a fair number of people put their Vim configuration files under version control, and that seemed like an effective solution, so I’ve gotten my .vimrc and .vim into a respectable state and added them to <a href="https://github.com/matthewbdaly/My-vim-configuration">a new repository</a>. Now I should have no excuse for letting them get out of sync.</p><p>I have to say, Github is a truly wonderful service. The tutorials for getting started with Git are really good, and make it easy to get started. It’s probably one of the main reasons why Git is becoming more and more popular- there isn’t really anything comparable for Subversion.</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">24th October 2011 10:18 pm</p><h1><a href="/blog/2011/10/24/linux-in-the-workplace/">Linux in the Workplace</a></h1><p>At the start of September I left my customer services role and started a new position as a web developer. I won’t give the name of either my old or new employer, but I will say that the new role is with a much smaller company, and the part I work for now is an e-commerce store that enjoys a significant degree of independence from the parent company. There are only two developers including myself, and we are solely responsible for the company’s IT infrastructure, and we don’t have the hassle of dealing with legacy applications or infrastructure. We therefore have considerable freedom in terms of what we choose to use to get our work done.</p><p>When I first started, I used Windows XP Professional since that was what my work laptop came with, but it soon became obvious that there wasn’t actually anything I specifically needed to be using Windows for. I mostly work on the company’s intranet, which doesn’t really need to be tested in Internet Explorer as we use Firefox internally. For email and calendar, we use Google Apps, which works fine with virtually any email client that supports IMAP, so I was using Thunderbird with the Lightning plugin. When coding I used Netbeans with the jVi plugin for most of my work, with occasional usage of Vim for writing shorter scripts. I used AppServ to provide local versions of Apache, MySQL and PHP, and I used PHPMyAdmin to interact with the database. For version control, I used Subversion. From time to time I need to remote into another machine using VNC, SSH or RDP, for which I used mRemote, but I was confident I could find an equivalent application. Also, we use Ubuntu on most of our servers, so it made a lot of sense from a compatibility point of view to also use it on my own desktop. From time to time, I also found myself writing bash or Perl scripts for systems administration purposes, and since it wasn’t really very practical to do that in Windows when it was going to be running in Ubuntu, I’d used an Ubuntu Server install in Virtualbox to write it, but it was obvious that running Ubuntu as my desktop OS would make more sense.</p><p>As Ubuntu 11.10 was due a little over a month after I first started, I decided to hold off making the switch until then so I could start with the most recent version and not have the hassle of upgrading an existing install. I had already downloaded the 64-bit version of Ubuntu 11.10 for my home machines and burned them to a CD, so I brought the CD into work and set up a dual boot so I could revert back to XP if anything went wrong, and also so I could easily copy across any files I needed from the Windows partition.</p><p>It took a fair while to get everything I wanted installed, but a lot less time than it would have taken if I’d set up Windows XP from scratch. The hardware all worked fine out of the box, and most of the software I needed was in the repositories. The only thing that I really needed that wasn’t there was Netbeans (which has apparently now been removed from the repositories), but the version in the Ubuntu repositories has never been very up-to-date anyway. Instead I installed the version of Netbeans available on the website, and that has worked fine for me. While there wasn’t a version of mRemote available, I did discover Remmina, which has proven to be an excellent client for SSH, RDP and VNC, to the point that I’ve now stopped using the terminal to connect via SSH in favour of using Remmina instead. Thunderbird does just as good a job with my email and calendar as it does on Windows, and I also have Mutt available. Naturally, it couldn’t be simpler to install a full LAMP stack and PHPMyAdmin either. In fact, the only application that I use much that I couldn’t get a decent version of was MySQL Workbench, and that was only because Oracle haven’t yet released a version for Ubuntu 11.10 (tried the version for 11.04, but it doesn’t seem to work), but I can live without that.</p><p>What’s interesting is that despite all the scaremongering I’ve heard over the years about how Linux isn’t ready for the workplace, I’ve as yet had no problems whatsoever. For everything I used in Windows, it was either available on Ubuntu, or there was a viable equivalent, or I could get by fine without it. Granted, the nature of my work means I have little need for the small amount of functionality that Microsoft Office has and LibreOffice doesn’t, and I don’t need to use the kind of ghastly legacy apps written in Visual Basic that most large enterprises commonly use, but I haven’t noticed any significant barriers to my productivity.</p><p>In fact, if anything I’m considerably more productive. I know people like to rag on Unity, and I wasn’t happy with it in the netbook edition of Ubuntu 10.10 myself, but in 11.10 it’s really starting to show its promise, and I haven’t had any problems with it. The fact that I know Ubuntu a lot more thoroughly than I do Windows, purely from my own experience at home, means that I can get things done a lot quicker, but also the whole package management system means I’m largely free from the annoyances of opening an application in the morning to be confronted with an update dialogue, quite apart from the fact that very few updates require a restart. I’d go so far as to say that I’ve been more productive using Ubuntu at work than I would have been with either Windows 7 or OS X (and over the last few years I’ve used Windows Vista, Windows 7 and OS X fairly extensively).</p><p>I really don’t want this to turn into Yet Another Year of the Linux Desktop blog post, because that’s rather a tired old cliche, but I have absolutely no problems whatsoever getting my work done on Ubuntu. I’ll concede that as a developer I have significant freedom that isn’t often afforded to other people, and running some flavour of Unix makes a lot of sense if you’re a developer working with one of the open-source server-side languages such as PHP or Python (if I were a .NET developer, it would make rather less sense). I’m also lucky to be in a position where I don’t have to worry about legacy apps or IE compatibility too much. Nonetheless, it’s still remarkable how smoothly my migration across to Ubuntu on my work desktop has gone, and the extent to which I find it’s improved my workflow.</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">29th May 2011 2:53 pm</p><h1><a href="/blog/2011/05/29/hacked/">Hacked!</a></h1><p>Had a rather unfortunate incident last month - someone hacked into my Pogoplug mail server, and managed to get their mitts on my .fetchmailrc, which had all the login details for several email accounts. They promptly began sending spam out using my Gmail account.</p><p>Naturally this meant I spent ages running round like a headless chicken trying to lock them out - when I first noticed that they’d been sending emails directly from my mail server, I logged into it via SSH and shut it down, then changed the passwords on all my email accounts.</p><p>Thinking logically, there were four services that I had forwarded ports to the server for - SSH, Apache, Postfix and Dovecot. Now, I was running SSH on a non-standard port, had disabled root access, and didn’t allow password authentication (SSH keys only). Also, I had enabled DenyHosts, so I’m fairly confident SSH was not the point of entry.</p><p>So that leaves either Apache, Postfix or Dovecot. I had noticed in the error logs a lot of characters prefixed with backslashes, and wondered if someone was trying some kind of shellcode injection, and to be safe I had added new iptables rules to blacklist the IP addresses responsible. I had done what I could to secure Apache, but I can’t rule it out as the application that was compromised. I went through the server logs, but without finding anything - I’m guessing whoever was responsible deleted the appropriate entries in the log files. I couldn’t be sure that the server could still be trusted, so I did a fresh install, and have disabled port forwarding on my router.</p><p>This has certainly made me much more cautious and suspicious about security, which I guess can’t be a bad thing. Even beforehand, I found it pretty scary to see the sheer number of script kiddies who will try to hack into any server on the Internet.</p></article></div><div class="col-md-4"><h1>Recent Posts</h1><p><a href="/blog/2015/08/01/exploring-the-hstorefield-in-django-1-dot-8/">Exploring the Hstorefield in Django 1.8</a></p><p><a href="/blog/2015/07/21/new-laptop/">New Laptop</a></p><p><a href="/blog/2015/07/04/handling-images-as-base64-strings-with-django-rest-framework/">Handling Images As Base64 Strings With Django REST Framework</a></p><p><a href="/blog/2015/06/17/getting-django-behave-and-celery-to-work-together/">Getting Django-behave and Celery to Work Together</a></p><p><a href="/blog/2015/06/14/setting-etags-in-laravel-5/">Setting Etags in Laravel 5</a></p><section id="github-profile"></section><h4>My GitHub repositories</h4><ul id="github-repos"><li>Loading repositories...</li></ul></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><ul class="pager"><li><a href="/posts/8/">Newer</a></li><li><a href="/posts/10/">Older</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class="container footercontainer"><div class="col-md-12"><p class="copyright">Copyright &copy; Matthew Daly 2015.</p></div></div></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/all.min.js"></script><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
