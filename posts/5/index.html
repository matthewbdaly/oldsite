        <h1><a href="/blog/2012/11/03/testing-php-web-applications-with-cucumber/">Testing PHP Web Applications With Cucumber</a></h1>
        <p>Ever since I first heard of <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>, it’s seemed like something I would find really useful. Like many developers, especially those who use PHP regularly, I know full well that I should make a point of writing proper automated tests for my web apps, but invariably wind up just thinking “I haven’t got time to get my head around a testing framework and it’ll take ages to set up, so I’ll just click around and look for bugs”. This does get very, very tedious quite quickly, however.</p>
<p>At work I’ve reached a point with  a web app I’m building where I needed to test it extensively to make sure it worked OK. I soon began to get very, very fed up of the repetitive clicking around necessary to test the application, so I began looking around for a solution. I gave Selenium IDE a try, but I found that to be annoyingly unreliable when recording tests. I’d heard of Cucumber, so I did some googling, found some resources, and began tinkering with that. Quite quickly, I had a few basic acceptance tests up and running that were much more reliable than Selenium IDE, and much less tedious to use than manual testing. Within a very short space of time, I realised that Cucumber was one of those tools that was going to dramatically improve my coding experience, much like when I switched from Subversion to Git.</p>
<p>What’s so great about Cucumber compared to other acceptance testing solutions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Cucumber scenarios are written using Gherkin, a simple syntax that makes it easy for customers to set out exactly what behaviour they want to see. Far from being tedious requirement documents, these set out in a simple and intuitive way what should happen once the application is complete. By requiring customers to think carefully about what they want and get it down in writing, you can ensure the customer has a good idea what they want before you write any code, making it much less likely they’ll turn around afterwards and say “No, that’s not what we want”. This, more than anything, is for me the true power of Cucumber - it allows customers and developers to easily collaborate to set out what the web app will do, and gets you automated tests into the bargain as well.</li>
<li>Because Cucumber is packaged as a Ruby gem, it’s easy to install it and any other Ruby modules it may require.</li>
<li>You can use Capybara to test your web app. Capybara is a very handy Ruby gem that allows you to easily interact with your web app, and it allows several different drivers to be used. If you don’t need JavaScript, for instance, you can use Mechanize for faster tests. If you do, you can use selenium-webdriver to automate the browser instead, and it will load an instance of Firefox and use that for testing.</li>
<li>It can also be used for testing RESTful web services. HTTParty is another handy Ruby gem that can be used for testing an API.</li>
</ul>
<p>One question you may ask is ‘Why use a Ruby tool to test PHP apps?’. Well, there is <a href="http://behat.org/">Behat</a>, a very similar tool for PHP, so you can use that if you’d prefer. However, I personally have found that it’s not too much of a problem switching context between writing Ruby code for the acceptance tests and PHP code for the application itself. Ruby also has some advantages here - <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a> is a very handy tool for running multiple instances of Ruby, and RubyGems makes it easy to install any additional modules you may need. You don’t really need to know much Ruby to use it - this is essentially my first encounter with Ruby barring a few small tutorials, but I haven’t had any significant issues with it. Finally, the Cucumber community seems to be very active, which is always a plus.</p>
<p>When searching for a tutorial on getting Cucumber working with PHP, I only found <a href="http://jamieonsoftware.com/journal/2011/1/2/high-level-testing-php-applications-with-cucumber.html">one good one</a>, and that didn’t cover a lot of the issues I’d have liked to cover, not did it cover actually using Cucumber as part of the development process, so I had to puzzle out much of it myself. So hopefully, by covering more of the ground that your average PHP developer is likely to need, I can show you just how useful Cucumber can be when added to your PHP development toolkit.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we’ll build a very simple todo-list application using the Slim framework, but we’ll use Cucumber to test it throughout to ensure that it works the way we want it to. Hopefully, by doing this, we’ll get a rock-solid web app that meets our requirements exactly.</p>
<p>First of all, you’ll want to install RVM to make it easier to manage multiple Ruby installs. You may be able to use your system’s Ruby install, but RVM is usually a safer bet:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash <span class="hljs-operator">-s</span> stable --ruby
</code></pre>
<p>This was sufficient to install RVM on Mac OS X. On Ubuntu, I also had to install the openssl and zlib packages. Before installing RVM, use apt-get to install the required packages:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">sudo apt-get install curl git git-core zlib1g-dev zlibc libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libyaml-dev build-essential checkinstall openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev zlib1g libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 autoconf libc6-dev ncurses-dev automake libtool bison subversion pkg-config
</code></pre>
<p>Once RVM is installed, then close and reopen your terminal so that RVM is loaded. Then, install the correct packages:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">rvm pkg install openssl zlib
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can install our new copy of Ruby. On Ubuntu, I had to install Ruby 1.8.7 first:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">rvm install <span class="hljs-number">1.8</span>.<span class="hljs-number">7</span>
rvm use <span class="hljs-number">1.8</span>.<span class="hljs-number">7</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Then I installed Ruby 1.9.3:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">rvm install <span class="hljs-number">1.9</span>.<span class="hljs-number">3</span> --with-openssl-dir=<span class="hljs-variable">$HOME</span>/.rvm/usr
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas on OS X, this is all that was required:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">rvm install <span class="hljs-number">1.9</span>.<span class="hljs-number">3</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Once that’s done, run the following to set the version of Ruby being used</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">rvm use <span class="hljs-number">1.9</span>.<span class="hljs-number">3</span>
</code></pre>
<p>With that done, you should be able to install the required Ruby gems. Now, you could install these manually, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">gem install cucumber
gem install rspec
gem install mechanize
gem install capybara
gem install selenium-webdriver
gem install capybara-mechanize
</code></pre>
<p>However, there’s a more convenient way. First, create a file in the project’s root directory called Gemfile and put the following content into it:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-ruby">source <span class="hljs-string">"http://rubygems.org"</span>
gem <span class="hljs-string">"cucumber"</span>
gem <span class="hljs-string">"rspec"</span>
gem <span class="hljs-string">"mechanize"</span>
gem <span class="hljs-string">"capybara"</span>
gem <span class="hljs-string">"selenium-webdriver"</span>
gem <span class="hljs-string">"capybara-mechanize"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Then install the Bundler gem:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">gem install bundler
</code></pre>
<p>Then use Bundler to install the required gems:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">bundle install
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it easier to get your project set up somewhere else because you can put the Gemfile under version control, making it easier to duplicate this setup elsewhere.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s start work on our app. To save time, we’ll use the Slim framework to do some of the heavy lifting for our application. Download <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a> and put it in a folder on your local web server.</p>
<p>Now, before we actually write any code, we’ll set out our first Cucumber scenario. Create a folder inside the folder you put Slim inside and call it <code>features</code>. Inside it, create a new file called <code>todo.feature</code> and put the following content into it:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-gherkin"><span class="hljs-keyword">Feature</span>: Todo

    In order to use the site
    As a user
    I want to be able to submit, view and delete to-do list items

    <span class="hljs-keyword">Scenario</span>: New item
        <span class="hljs-keyword">Given</span> I am on the home page
        <span class="hljs-keyword">When</span> I click on New Item
        <span class="hljs-keyword">And</span> I fill in the item
        <span class="hljs-keyword">And</span> I click the button Submit
        <span class="hljs-keyword">Then</span> I should see the new item added to the list
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how simple this is? Everything is written as an example of how an end user would interact with the site. There’s nothing hard about this - it just describes what the site needs to do.</p>
<p>The first line is just the name of this feature. The following three lines are just a comment. Then the Scenario line gives a name to this particular scenario - a Scenario is just a series of steps that describes an action.</p>
<p>Then, we see the Given line. This sets out the starting conditions. Note that you can easily set out multiple starting conditions using the And keyword on subsequent lines, as we do later in the file. Here, we’re just making sure we’re on the home page.</p>
<p>Next, we see the When line. This, and the subsequent And lines, set out what actions we want to take when going through this step. In this example, we’re clicking on a link marked ‘New Item’, filling in a text input, and clicking the Submit button. So we’re already thinking about how our application is going to work, before we’ve written a line of code.</p>
<p>Finally, we see the Then line. This sets out what should have happened once we’ve finished going through this step. Here we want to make sure the new item has been added to the list.</p>
<p>Now, go to the folder you unpacked Slim into and run <code>cucumber</code> from the shell. You should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-sh"><span class="hljs-attribute">Feature</span>: <span class="hljs-string">Todo</span>

<span class="livecodeserver">    In order <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> use <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> site
    As <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> user
    I want <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> be able <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> submit, view <span class="hljs-operator">and</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">delete</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span>-<span class="hljs-built_in">do</span> list <span class="hljs-keyword">items</span>

  Scenario: New <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span>                                 <span class="hljs-comment"># features/todo.feature:7</span>
    Given I am <span class="hljs-command"><span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> <span class="hljs-title">the</span> <span class="hljs-title">home</span> <span class="hljs-title">page</span>                      # <span class="hljs-title">features</span>/<span class="hljs-title">todo</span>.<span class="hljs-title">feature</span>:<span class="hljs-title">8</span></span>
    When I click <span class="hljs-command"><span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> <span class="hljs-title">New</span> <span class="hljs-title">Item</span>                         # <span class="hljs-title">features</span>/<span class="hljs-title">todo</span>.<span class="hljs-title">feature</span>:<span class="hljs-title">9</span></span>
    And I fill <span class="hljs-operator">in</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span>                           <span class="hljs-comment"># features/todo.feature:10</span>
    And I click <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> button Submit                    <span class="hljs-comment"># features/todo.feature:11</span>
    Then I should see <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">new</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span> added <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> list <span class="hljs-comment"># features/todo.feature:12</span>

<span class="hljs-number">1</span> scenario (<span class="hljs-number">1</span> undefined)
<span class="hljs-number">5</span> steps (<span class="hljs-number">5</span> undefined)
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>m0<span class="hljs-number">.004</span>s

You can implement step definitions <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> undefined steps <span class="hljs-operator">with</span> these snippets:

Given /^I am <span class="hljs-command"><span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> <span class="hljs-title">the</span> <span class="hljs-title">home</span> <span class="hljs-title">page</span>$/ <span class="hljs-title">do</span></span>
  pending <span class="hljs-comment"># express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">end</span></span>

When /^I click <span class="hljs-command"><span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> <span class="hljs-title">New</span> <span class="hljs-title">Item</span>$/ <span class="hljs-title">do</span></span>
  pending <span class="hljs-comment"># express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">end</span></span>

When /^I fill <span class="hljs-operator">in</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span>$/ <span class="hljs-built_in">do</span>
  pending <span class="hljs-comment"># express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">end</span></span>

When /^I click <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> button Submit$/ <span class="hljs-built_in">do</span>
  pending <span class="hljs-comment"># express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">end</span></span>

Then /^I should see <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">new</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span> added <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> list$/ <span class="hljs-built_in">do</span>
  pending <span class="hljs-comment"># express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">end</span></span>

If you want snippets <span class="hljs-operator">in</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> different programming language,
just make sure <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">file</span> <span class="hljs-operator">with</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> appropriate <span class="hljs-built_in">file</span> extension
exists where cucumber looks <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> step definitions.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>At this stage, Cucumber isn’t doing anything much, it’s just telling you that these steps haven’t been defined as yet. To define a step, you simply write some Ruby code that expresses that step.</p>
<p>Let’s do that. Under <code>features</code>, create a new directory called <code>step_definitions</code>. Inside that, create a file called <code>todo_steps.rb</code> and paste the code snippets returned by Cucumber into it. Once that has been saved, run <code>cucumber</code> again and you should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">Feature: Todo

    In order to use the site
    As a user
    I want to be able to submit, view and delete to-do list items

  Scenario: New item                                 <span class="hljs-comment"># features/todo.feature:7</span>
    Given I am on the home page                      <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:1</span>
      TODO (Cucumber::Pending)
      ./features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:<span class="hljs-number">2</span>:<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> `/^I am on the home page$/<span class="hljs-string">'
      features/todo.feature:8:in `Given I am on the home page'</span>
    When I click on New Item                         <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:5</span>
    And I fill <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the item                           <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:9</span>
    And I click the button Submit                    <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:13</span>
    Then I should see the new item added to the list <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:17</span>

<span class="hljs-number">1</span> scenario (<span class="hljs-number">1</span> pending)
<span class="hljs-number">5</span> steps (<span class="hljs-number">4</span> skipped, <span class="hljs-number">1</span> pending)
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>m0.<span class="hljs-number">004</span>s
</code></pre>
<p>So far, the steps we’ve written don’t actually do anything - each step contains nothing but the pending statement. We need to replace the code inside each of those steps with some Ruby code that implements that step. As the first step in this scenario is still pending, Cucumber skips all the remaining steps.</p>
<p>Let’s implement these steps. First of all, we need to set some configuration options. In the <code>features</code> folder, create a new folder called <code>support</code>, and under that create a new file called <code>env.rb</code>. In there, place the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-ruby"><span class="hljs-keyword">require</span> <span class="hljs-string">'rspec/expectations'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">require</span> <span class="hljs-string">'capybara'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">require</span> <span class="hljs-string">'capybara/mechanize'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">require</span> <span class="hljs-string">'capybara/cucumber'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">require</span> <span class="hljs-string">'test/unit/assertions'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">require</span> <span class="hljs-string">'mechanize'</span>

<span class="hljs-constant">World</span>(<span class="hljs-constant">Test::Unit::Assertions</span>)

<span class="hljs-constant">Capybara</span>.default_driver = <span class="hljs-symbol">:mechanize</span>
<span class="hljs-constant">Capybara</span>.app_host = <span class="hljs-string">"http://localhost"</span>
<span class="hljs-constant">World</span>(<span class="hljs-constant">Capybara</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>This includes all of the Ruby gems required for our purposes, and sets Capybara to use the Mechanize driver for testing web apps. If you’ve not heard of it before, Capybara can be thought of as a way of scripting a web browser that supports numerous drivers, some of which are headless and some of which aren’t. Here we’re using Mechanize, which is headless, but later on we’ll use Selenium to show you how it would work with a non-headless web browser.</p>
<p>With that done, the next job is to actually implement the steps. Head back to <code>features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb</code> and edit it as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-ruby"><span class="hljs-constant">Given</span> /^<span class="hljs-constant">I</span> am on the home page<span class="hljs-variable">$/</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
    visit <span class="hljs-string">"http://localhost/~matthewdaly/todo/index.php"</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>

<span class="hljs-constant">When</span> /^<span class="hljs-constant">I</span> click on <span class="hljs-constant">New</span> <span class="hljs-constant">Item</span><span class="hljs-variable">$/</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
      pending <span class="hljs-comment"># express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>

<span class="hljs-constant">When</span> /^<span class="hljs-constant">I</span> fill <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the item<span class="hljs-variable">$/</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
      pending <span class="hljs-comment"># express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>

<span class="hljs-constant">When</span> /^<span class="hljs-constant">I</span> click the button <span class="hljs-constant">Submit</span><span class="hljs-variable">$/</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
      pending <span class="hljs-comment"># express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>

<span class="hljs-constant">Then</span> /^<span class="hljs-constant">I</span> should see the new item added to the list<span class="hljs-variable">$/</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
      pending <span class="hljs-comment"># express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Don’t forget to replace the URL in that first step with the one pointing at your index.php for your local copy of Slim. At this point we’re only implementing the first step, so that’s all we need to do for now. Once that’s done, go back to the root of the web app and run <code>cucumber</code> again. You should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">Feature: Todo

    In order to use the site
    As a user
    I want to be able to submit, view and delete to-do list items

  Scenario: New item                                 <span class="hljs-comment"># features/todo.feature:7</span>
    Given I am on the home page                      <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:1</span>
    When I click on New Item                         <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:5</span>

      features/todo.feature:9:in `When I click on New Item'</span>
    And I fill <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the item                           <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:9</span>
    And I click the button Submit                    <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:13</span>
    Then I should see the new item added to the list <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:17</span>

<span class="hljs-number">1</span> scenario (<span class="hljs-number">1</span> pending)
<span class="hljs-number">5</span> steps (<span class="hljs-number">3</span> skipped, <span class="hljs-number">1</span> pending, <span class="hljs-number">1</span> passed)
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>m0.<span class="hljs-number">036</span>s
</code></pre>
<p>Our first step has passed! Now, we move onto the next step. Open features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb again, and amend the second step definition as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-ruby"><span class="hljs-constant">When</span> /^<span class="hljs-constant">I</span> click on <span class="hljs-constant">New</span> <span class="hljs-constant">Item</span><span class="hljs-variable">$/</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
   click_link (<span class="hljs-string">'New Item'</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, hang on a minute here. This Ruby code is pretty easy to understand - it just clicks on a link with the title, ID or text ‘New Item’. But we don’t want to have to rewrite this step for every single link in the application. Wouldn’t it be great if we could have this step definition accept any text and click on the appropriate link, so we could reuse it elsewhere? Well, we can. Change the second step to look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-ruby"><span class="hljs-constant">When</span> /^<span class="hljs-constant">I</span> click on (.*)<span class="hljs-variable">$/</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> |link|
    click_link (link)
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>What’s happening here is that we capture the text after the word ‘on’ using a regular expression and pass it through to the step definition as the variable <code>link</code>. Then, we have Capybara click on that link. Pretty simple, and it saves us on some work in future.</p>
<p>Now run <code>cucumber</code> again, and you should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">Feature: Todo

</code></pre>
<p>We’ve got our second step in place, but it’s failing because there is no link with the text ‘New Item’. Let’s remedy that. Head back to the folder you put Slim in, and open index.php.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-php"><span class="hljs-preprocessor">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">require</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Slim/Slim.php'</span>;

\Slim\Slim::registerAutoloader();

<span class="hljs-variable">$app</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> \Slim\Slim();

<span class="hljs-comment">// GET route</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">$app</span>-&gt;get(<span class="hljs-string">'/'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-variable">$template</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&lt;&lt;&lt;EOT
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Todo list&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;a href="index.php/newitem"&gt;New Item&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
EOT;</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$template</span>;
});

<span class="hljs-variable">$app</span>-&gt;run();
<span class="hljs-preprocessor">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Here I’ve stripped out most of the default code and comments so we can see more easily what’s happening. If you haven’t used Slim before, it works by letting you define routes that are accessed via HTTP GET, POST, PUT or DELETE methods, and define what the response will be to each one. Here, we’ve defined a simple controller for GET requests to ‘/‘, and we return a template that includes a link with the text ‘New Item’.</p>
<p>Now, run <code>cucumber</code> again and you should see the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">Feature: Todo

<p>Our second step is still failing, but only because we haven’t yet defined a route for the destination when we click on the link, so let’s fix that. Open up index.php again and change it to look like this:</p>

<p>We’re just adding a new route to handle what happens when we click the link here. The new page also has a form for submitting the new item.</p>
<p>With that done, the second step should be in place. Run <code>cucumber</code> again and you should see something like this:</p>

<p>So onto the third step. We’ve already created the input for filling in the item, so all we need to do to make this step pass is write an appropriate step definition:</p>

    And I click the button Submit                    <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:13</span>
    Then I should see the new item added to the list <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:17</span>

<p>On to our final step. We want to make sure the page contains the text we submitted, which is very easy to do with Capybara. Change the final step to look like this:</p>

<p>We’re nearly done here, but first there’s a couple of other handy things you can do with Cucumber that I’d like to show you. We’ve been using the Mechanize driver for Capybara, which is very fast and efficient. However, it’s effectively a text-mode browser like Lynx, so it can’t be used to test any functionality that relies on JavaScript. However, Mechanize isn’t the only driver available for Capybara, and you can switch to the JavaScript driver when necessary so you can test. The default JavaScript driver is Selenium, which will launch an instance of Firefox and use that for the test.</p>
<p>It’s easy to switch to the JavaScript driver when you need it. Just tag the scenario with @javascript, as in this example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-gherkin"><span class="hljs-keyword">Feature</span>: Todo

    In order to use the site
    As a user
    I want to be able to submit, view and delete to-do list items

    <span class="hljs-comment">@javascript</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">Scenario</span>: New item
        <span class="hljs-keyword">Given</span> I am on the home page
        <span class="hljs-keyword">When</span> I click on New Item
        <span class="hljs-keyword">And</span> I fill in the item
        <span class="hljs-keyword">And</span> I click the button Submit
        <span class="hljs-keyword">Then</span> I should see the new item added to the list
</code></pre>
<p>Now run <code>cucumber</code> again and this time it will fire up an instance of Firefox and use that to run the tests. This can also be handy for debugging purposes since, unlike with Mechanize, you can see the pages.</p>
<p>Finally, what about if you want to test the same functionality multiple times with different input? You don’t want to have to write out multiple scenarios that are virtually identical, even if you have refactored them to make them more useful. What you need is a way to repeat the same test, only with different input each time.</p>
<p>Handily, Cucumber can do this too. First, let’s refactor the code for our step definitions so the final step can handle any text:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-ruby"><span class="hljs-constant">Given</span> /^<span class="hljs-constant">I</span> am on the home page<span class="hljs-variable">$/</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
    visit <span class="hljs-string">"http://localhost/~matthewdaly/todo/index.php"</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>

<span class="hljs-constant">When</span> /^<span class="hljs-constant">I</span> click on (.*)<span class="hljs-variable">$/</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> |link|
    click_link (link)
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>

<span class="hljs-constant">When</span> /^<span class="hljs-constant">I</span> fill <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the item with (.*)<span class="hljs-variable">$/</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> |item|
    fill_in <span class="hljs-string">'item'</span>, <span class="hljs-symbol">:with</span> =&gt; item
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>

<span class="hljs-constant">When</span> /^<span class="hljs-constant">I</span> click the button (.*)<span class="hljs-variable">$/</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> |button|
    click_button (button)
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>

<span class="hljs-constant">Then</span> /^<span class="hljs-constant">I</span> should see the text (.*)<span class="hljs-variable">$/</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> |text|
    page.should have_content(text)
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Here we’ve changed the third and fifth items so we can pass any value we want through to them. As I mentioned earlier, this is good practice since it means we don’t have to write more code for our tests than we need to.</p>
<p>With that done, open up the feature file and amend it to look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-gherkin"><span class="hljs-keyword">Feature</span>: Todo

    In order to use the site
    As a user
    I want to be able to submit, view and delete to-do list items

    <span class="hljs-comment">@javascript</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">Scenario</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Outline</span>: New item
        <span class="hljs-keyword">Given</span> I am on the home page
        <span class="hljs-keyword">When</span> I click on New Item
        <span class="hljs-keyword">And</span> I fill in the item with <span class="hljs-variable">&lt;item&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">And</span> I click the button Submit
        <span class="hljs-keyword">Then</span> I should see the text <span class="hljs-variable">&lt;item&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">Examples</span>:
        <span class="hljs-string">| item                      |   
        | Feed cat                  |   
        | Stop milk                 |   
        | Take over world           |</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you then run <code>cucumber</code> again, the scenario should run three times, each time entering different text:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">Feature: Todo

    In order to use the site
    As a user
    I want to be able to submit, view and delete to-do list items

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: New item           <span class="hljs-comment"># features/todo.feature:8</span>
    Given I am on the home page        <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:1</span>
    When I click on New Item           <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:5</span>
    And I fill <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the item with &lt;item&gt; <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:9</span>
    And I click the button Submit      <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:13</span>
    Then I should see the text &lt;item&gt;  <span class="hljs-comment"># features/step_definitions/todo_steps.rb:17</span>

    Examples: 
      | item            |
      | Feed cat        |
      | Stop milk       |
      | Take over world |

<span class="hljs-number">3</span> scenarios (<span class="hljs-number">3</span> passed)
<span class="hljs-number">15</span> steps (<span class="hljs-number">15</span> passed)
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>m25.<span class="hljs-number">936</span>s
</code></pre>
<p>With only a few changes, we’re now running the same scenario over and over again with different input, and testing the output is correct for each one. This makes it very easy to test repetitive content. For instance, if you had an e-commerce site with lots of products and you wanted to test the pages for some of the products, you could put them in a table like this. You can have more than one column if necessary, so you could write a scenario like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-gherkin">    <span class="hljs-keyword">Scenario</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Outline</span>: Test products
        <span class="hljs-keyword">Given</span> I am on the home page
        <span class="hljs-keyword">When</span> I search for <span class="hljs-variable">&lt;product&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">And</span> I click on the first result
        <span class="hljs-keyword">Then</span> I should not see any errors
        <span class="hljs-keyword">And</span> I should see the text <span class="hljs-variable">&lt;productname&gt;</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">Examples</span>:
        <span class="hljs-string">| product           | productname                           |
        | supersprocket     | Super Sprocket 3000                   |</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, Cucumber is a really simple way to start testing your web apps, and can really improve the quality of your code. Even if you’ve never used Ruby before, <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#readme">Capybara’s API</a> is very simple and intuitive, and should adequately cover most of what you need to do when testing a web app.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the PHP community in general has been a bit slack in terms of getting proper automated tests working. But Cucumber makes it so simple, and offers so many other benefits, such as human-readable tests and getting stakeholders more involved in the development process, that there’s really no excuse not to use it. Hope you’ve enjoyed this tutorial, and that it’s encouraged you to start using Cucumber to test your own web apps.</p>

        <h1><a href="/blog/2012/09/05/counting-commits-in-git/">Counting Commits in Git</a></h1>
        <p>The other day I got to wondering about how I could quickly and easily count how many commits I was making to a specific Git repository every day.</p>
<p>Now, with the default log output, Git shows the date and time at the top of each entry. So in order to determine how many commits have been made to a given repository, all you need to do is determine today’s date, and see how many times that date appears in the log.</p>
<p>So, first task is to get the log. Then, we need to get today’s date, format it appropriately, and use grep to filter for just the lines containing that date. So, we use the date command to fetch the date, then pipe it into awk, which we use to format it the same way as Git does. We then use grep to filter out the lines that have the resulting date. Finally, we use wc to count the number of lines returned by grep.</p>
<p>Here’s what I came up with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-bash">git <span class="hljs-built_in">log</span> | grep <span class="hljs-string">"`date | awk '{print <span class="hljs-variable">$1</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$2</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$3</span>}'`"</span> | wc <span class="hljs-operator">-l</span>
</code></pre>
<p>I’m not that great with tools like awk, so I’m quite proud of managing to do this. It’s quite handy to have around.</p>

        <h1><a href="/blog/2012/08/13/falling-back-to-local-copies-of-jquery-and-jquery-mobile/">Falling Back to Local Copies of Jquery and Jquery Mobile</a></h1>
        <p>I use jQuery Mobile a lot at work, and it’s brilliant. For quickly knocking together a high-quality user interface that works well on mobile devices, it’s unbeatable.</p>
<p>Like many web developers, I favour using a CDN-hosted version of both jQuery and jQuery Mobile, because it makes it more likely that the user won’t have to download the appropriate files as their web browser has already cached them. However, by doing this you run the risk of your site being negatively affected if the CDN provider goes down for any length of time. So, I think it’s a good idea to have a fallback for both jQuery and jQuery Mobile.</p>
<p>I spent a while looking and finally managed to come up with a solution that works well, and borrows heavily from <a href="http://timjames.me/jquery-and-jquery-ui-fallbacks">a similar solution for jQuery UI by Tim James</a>. First of all, load the stylesheets and JavaScript files as usual:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">link</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">rel</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">href</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.1.1/jquery.mobile.structure-1.1.1.min.css"</span> /&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">script</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">src</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript"></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">script</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">src</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.1.1/jquery.mobile-1.1.1.min.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript"></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Below this, place the following inside another set of script tags:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> jQuery == <span class="hljs-string">'undefined'</span>)
{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.write(<span class="hljs-built_in">unescape</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"%3Cscript src='http://path-to-jquery.min.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"</span>));
}
</code></pre>
<p> If jQuery is not defined, this will write another set of script tags that will load the local copy of jQuery. Now, inside a second set of script tags, place the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> $.mobile == <span class="hljs-string">'undefined'</span>)
{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.write(<span class="hljs-built_in">unescape</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"%3Cscript src='http://path-to-jquery-mobile.min.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"</span>));
}

$(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>($(<span class="hljs-string">'.ui-helper-hidden:first'</span>).is(<span class="hljs-string">':visible'</span>) === <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>){
        $(<span class="hljs-string">'&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://path-to-jquery-mobile-structure.min.css" /&gt;'</span>).appendTo(<span class="hljs-string">'head'</span>);
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>This won’t work if it’s placed in the same set of script tags as the code above, because it requires that jQuery be working already. The first part works similarly to the jQuery fallback - if jQuery Mobile is not defined, it writes a new script tag. The second relies on an element in the DOM with a class of ui-helper-hidden, which jQuery Mobile would hide by default if it were loaded. If it is visible, the jQuery Mobile structure CSS file has not been loaded and so a link to the local copy of the stylesheet is created.  Of course, this means you have to create this element, so add the following code to the very top of the body, directly under the opening body tag:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-html">&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">div</span> <span class="hljs-type">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"ui-helper-hidden"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">div</span>&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you download copies of the appropriate files and set the paths to them correctly, you should now be able to enjoy all the advantages of using a CDN for hosting jQuery and jQuery Mobile while also having the security of knowing that if the CDN goes down, your application will still work fine. Exactly the same approach will work with jQuery UI as well.</p>

        <h1><a href="/blog/2012/05/31/dumping-wordpress-for-octopress/">Dumping Wordpress for Octopress</a></h1>
        <p>Lately I’ve gotten more and more fed up with WordPress as a blogging platform. It’s certainly a great content management system, and for non-technical bloggers it’s absolutely perfect, but I’ve been increasingly finding myself hitting barriers that make it harder than it should be to get stuff done. It’s just not the best platform for blogging about web development.</p>
<p>Take my recent series of Django tutorials, for example. You wouldn’t believe the amount of time I spent trying to format some of the code properly in TinyMCE for those. Furthermore, the end result, even though the theme was a custom one I’d built myself that was somewhat optimised for showing off code, wasn’t exactly great.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Markdown is a far better option for writing blog posts in than using a rich text editor like TinyMCE. You normally have a pretty good idea what the end results will look like, and it’s generally well-formatted HTML. Also, it means I can easily write my blog posts in Vim.</p>
<p>Octopress was therefore an obvious choice. It’s absolutely brilliant for sharing code - compared to WordPress, code samples look <em>stunning</em>. Also, because it generates static HTML, it loads an awful lot faster than WordPress does, and the default theme is extremely nice. So that’s what I’ve gone for.</p>
<p>The only issue is that my web host are a bit funny about offering SSH access, so I’ve resorted to FTP-ing the files across, which isn’t ideal. Still, it’s not that big an issue, and I’ll have to see how it goes with Octopress. I do have a low-end VPS I could point this domain name at instead and run it from there if necessary, so I can always resort to that if this is too cumbersome.</p>

        <p>In this instalment I’ll be showing you how we can make our blogging engine a little nicer to look at by adding some CSS and images, as well as expanding on Django’s templating system.</p>
<p>First of all, let’s add some CSS to our blog. When developing a web app with Django, you should place static files such as stylesheets and images in a folder inside your app (not project) folder called static. My project is called DjangoBlog, and my app is called blogengine, so all my static content should go in DjangoBlog/blogengine/static/. Here’s the stylesheet, which I’ve saved as style.css:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-css"><span class="hljs-tag">body</span> <span class="hljs-rules">{

<p>In the same folder, I have a PNG icon for an RSS feed, and if you had some JavaScript files you wanted to use (such as a copy of jQuery), you would put them here too. Note that there’s nothing to stop you creating subfolders within /static, and in fact I would recommend you do so for any future project so you can separate out images, CSS and JavaScript easily.</p>
<p>With that done, we now need to change our templates to make use of this CSS. Here’s what header.html should look like:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-html"><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">html</span>&gt;</span>

</code></pre>
<p>Phew! There’s quite a lot there, so you may wish to grab these files from the GitHub repository rather than enter them yourself.</p>
<p>Now, all of the references to the CSS or image file need to refer to the /static folder under the root of the web server. Here’s the reference to our stylesheet:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-html">&lt;link <span class="hljs-variable">rel=</span><span class="hljs-string">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">type=</span><span class="hljs-string">"text/css"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">href=</span><span class="hljs-string">"/static/style.css"</span> /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And here’s where we get the image:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-html">&lt;<span class="hljs-tag">a</span> href=<span class="hljs-string">"/feeds/posts/"</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="hljs-tag">img</span> src=<span class="hljs-string">"/static/rss.png"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">width</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"50px"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">height</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"50px"</span>&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>All of our static files can be referenced via the /static folder by default, without needing to set up a rule to cover them in urls.py.</p>
<p>One other point worth noting is that we’ve added some code to the header to display links to all of the flat pages. This particular snippet of code in header.html is noteworthy:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-html"><span class="xml"></span><span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">load</span> flatpages %}</span><span class="xml">
                </span><span class="hljs-template_tag">{% get_flatpages <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> flatpages %}</span><span class="xml">
                </span><span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> flatpage <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> flatpages %}</span><span class="xml">
                <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">li</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">a</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">href</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"</span></span></span><span class="hljs-variable">{{ flatpage.url }}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-value">"</span>&gt;</span></span><span class="hljs-variable">{{ flatpage.title }}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">a</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">li</span>&gt;</span>
                </span><span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">endfor</span> %}</span><span class="xml"></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we first of all load the flat pages. Then we retrieve them, and loop through each of them. For each page, we create a new list item containing a link to the flat page, with the text being the flat page’s title. Note that we’re just referring to each flatpage object’s attributes here. Then we end the for loop.</p>
<p>The only problem with this is that all of the pages except the flat pages are handled by the blogengine application, not the flatpages one, so we can’t get the values for the flat pages, so we need to amend blogengine/views.py. Open it and add the following line near the top:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> django.contrib.flatpages.models <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> FlatPage
</code></pre>
<p>Now, nowhere else in the view is the FlatPage application needed, but it’s required in the template, so by importing it here we make it available in the template.</p>
<p>With that done, our Django-powered blog is beginning to look a bit more presentable, so I’ll leave it to you to style it however you wish, using this as a starting point. The blog is now pretty much feature-complete, however there’s one more thing I’d like to demonstrate before we finish up, namely generic views.</p>
<p>As you may have gathered by now, Django uses slightly different terminology to many other web development frameworks. Although it can be considered an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework like many others, it’s generally referred to as an MTV (Model-Template-View) framework, with views containing the logic needed to present the data. While Django ships with a number of built-in applications to do certain repetitive tasks easily, not every task lends itself well to being handled by one generic application. However, these tasks may still require something similar be implemented over and over again, and that’s what generic views are for.</p>
<p>We don’t yet have a list of all of the available categories, so let’s use a generic view to do that. In urls.py, add the following lines at the top:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> django.views.generic <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> ListView
<span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> blogengine.models <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Category
</code></pre>
<p>Then, add the following lines at the top of the section for categories:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-python">    url(<span class="hljs-string">r'^categories/?$'</span>, ListView.as_view(
        model=Category,
        )),
</code></pre>
<p>Then, go into your templates folder and create a new folder in there called blogengine (or whatever you’re calling your blog application). In there, create a new file called category_list.html and enter the following code in it:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-html"><span class="xml"></span><span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> 'header.html' %}</span><span class="xml">
        </span><span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> category <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> object_list %}</span><span class="xml">
            <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">h3</span>&gt;</span></span><span class="hljs-variable">{{ category.title }}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">h3</span>&gt;</span>
            <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">p</span>&gt;</span></span><span class="hljs-variable">{{ category.description }}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">p</span>&gt;</span>
        </span><span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">endfor</span> %}</span><span class="xml">
</span><span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> 'footer.html' %}</span><span class="xml"></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, ensure the development server is running, and go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/categories/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/categories/</a>, and you should see a list of your categories.</p>
<p>Now, you didn’t write a view for this at all. Instead, this is handled by a generic view. In urls.py, we imported the ListView generic view, which is nothing more than a list of objects. We then import the Category model. Then, we define a URLconf that maps the categories/ url to ListView, which displays a list of all the Category objects. The template used is determined automatically, and we create that template as normal. Note that in the template we refer to object_list - this demonstrates that we’re referring to the objects passed through generically, and in theory this same template could display any objects with attributes called title and description.</p>
<p>Now, it probably won’t have escaped your notice that a blog is effectively a list of posts, so can’t we use a generic view to display them? Well, yes we can! So why don’t we cut down on the amount of code we need to maintain and use a generic view, rather than writing our own view?</p>
<p>Go into blogengine/views.py and delete the getPosts function in its entirety. Next, go into urls.py and delete the part that deals with showing the posts (the two lines just under the Home page comment), and replace them with this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-python">    url(<span class="hljs-string">r'^(?P&lt;page&gt;\d+)?/?$'</span>, ListView.as_view(
        model=Post,
        paginate_by=<span class="hljs-number">5</span>,
        )),
</code></pre>
<p>Note here that we specify how many items we paginate by. The ListView generic view supports pagination, making it ideally suited for any list of objects that may be spread across multiple pages - you just import the model you want and pass it through in the model parameter.</p>
<p>We also need to import the Post object in urls.py. Amend the line where you imported the Category model as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> blogengine.models <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Category, Post
</code></pre>
<p>Then move posts.html into your templates/blogengine folder and rename it post_list.html, then amend it to look like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-html"><span class="xml"></span><span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> 'header.html' %}</span><span class="xml">
        </span><span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">load</span> comments %}</span><span class="xml">
        </span><span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> object_list %}</span><span class="xml">
        </span><span class="hljs-template_tag">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> post <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> object_list %}</span><span class="xml">
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">class</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"post"</span>&gt;</span>

</code></pre>
<p>The changes here are minimal, just adjusting the names of objects to what the generic view uses. Now, if you refresh the browser, you should be able to see your blog posts, only now they’re being handled by Django’s ListView generic view. But they’re in the wrong order, so go into blogengine/models.py and add this code to the Post model:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs lang-python">    <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Meta</span>:</span>
        ordering = [<span class="hljs-string">"-pub_date"</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>This defines the order the Post objects should be in the model, rather than the view. If you now refresh the browser, they should be in the right order.</p>
<p>A ListView is only one of the generic views available in Django. There are others that are useful under other circumstances, but they’re beyond the scope of this tutorial, so I suggest that if you’re interested, you take the time to learn more about them on your own. They can save you a lot of time and effort if used well.</p>
<p>Sadly, that brings this series of tutorials to an end. I hope you’ve enjoyed learning about Django, and I hope you’ll be inspired to build something cool with it! As always, the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/matthewbdaly/Django-Tutorial-Blog">GitHub</a>, so feel free to download it, use it as the basis for your own projects, or whatever else you’d like to do with it.</p>
