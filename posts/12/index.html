While it’s a fine distro, I always felt that Debian would have been a much better fit. Partly this is because Debian has established a strong history of being a solid, stable distro that would carry on working no matter what, whereas Arch is more bleeding-edge. Also, Debian has a colossal repository that included a lot of software I wanted that wasn’t in the Arch repositories and I couldn’t get to install or compile from source, such as procmail and Squirrelmail. Debian also has strong support for many different processor architectures, including armel. Finally, being an Ubuntu user on the desktop, Debian is a distro that feels much more familiar to me.</p><p>So I eventually gave up on running Plugbox Linux and took the opportunity of the release of Debian Squeeze to install it on my Pogoplug, thanks to <a href="http://jeff.doozan.com/debian/">this tutorial</a>. With that done, I set about adding my favourite applications. Byobu is a really handy tool that makes GNU screen significantly more intuitive and useful, so that’s always one of the first things to go on, and one that I’d really missed in Plugbox. I’ve now gotten my mail server working again, with the addition of procmail as my mail filter and Squirrelmail to give me a web interface. I’ve also set up Leafnode on there as I’d really like to learn more about Usenet, and I’m beginning to get the hang of using slrn to read it.</p><p>It’s amazing how much running my own server has taught me about security. I was staggered to see the sheer number of attempts by script kiddies to connect via SSH to my Pogoplug, and it really made me start thinking about security in a way I’d never bothered beforehand. I’ve installed denyhosts to block atttempts to brute-force the password, and made sure I chose a good password. I’ve also set OpenSSH to listen on a different port, which should hopefully decrease the number of login attempts substantially (I presume most of these were just script kiddies scanning large blocks of IP addresses looking for hosts with port 22 open), and have disabled root login (as at right now my login is the only one that is allowed via SSH, so if anyone does bother to do a more thorough scan and try to connect to the port I’m running SSH on, they’ll need to guess my username AND password, and do so before denyhosts kicks them off - a pretty tall order).</p><p>The whole concept of “plug servers” is one I really like, and my experience with the Pogoplug has been extremely good - it’s an inexpensive and extremely hackable device that has been an absolute pleasure to use.</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">24th January 2011 12:30 am</p><h1><a href="/blog/2011/01/24/my-new-mini-server/">My New Mini Server</a></h1><p>For a while now I’ve wanted a home server of some description, the idea being that it was something I could use to run a web server for development purposes, and a mail server so I could have an offline backup for my Gmail account (considering how much I rely on it, it’s only prudent to plan for what might happen if Gmail went down), and whatever else I need. Also, I only have laptops at present so I liked the idea of having something I could leave on all the time and connect to remotely via SSH.</p><p>Around Christmas, I read a forum post by someone who’d bought a PogoPlug cheap from PC World and had hacked it into a web server using Plugbox Linux, an Arch-based Linux distro. Shortly afterwards, I went into a branch of Currys in Norwich, and they had one on sale (£20 off the RRP of £70), so I shelled out for it. I already had a load of USB flash drives lying around, and an 8GB one is big enough for what I had in mind. After all, I wasn’t going to be serving anything that demanding over it, so something small and low-powered should be fine.</p><p>This weekend I finally got round to getting it set up. The PogoPlug service is actually pretty good - if you’re unfamiliar with it, it’s basically a self-hosted version of Dropbox, where you buy the device, connect it to your router, attach up to 4 flash drives or hard drives via USB, then share the files stored on them easily across your home network or over the Internet. However, this wasn’t really what I wanted.</p><p>Installing Plugbox Linux wasn’t hard - I merely had to activate SSH from the PogoPlug’s control panel, connect and kill the hbwd process, then install a new bootloader to enable it to boot the new OS. Once that was done, it was a case of attaching a flash drive, ensuring it was correctly mounted and the filesystem was set up properly, then downloading the Plugbox Linux tarball and unpacking it on the flash drive, before rebooting into the new OS.</p><p>Once it was installed, it wasn’t too hard to get the hang of pacman. I’d prefer it to have been Debian-based as that’s what I’m most familiar with, but that’s just personal preference. After a little tinkering I now have Postfix and Dovecot working on there, as well as Apache (although it might make sense to switch to something lighter, such as lighttpd or Cherokee). I’ve given it a fully qualified domain name via a free subdomain at dyndns.org, and I can now access emails on there via IMAP. Outgoing email works fine too, so I can always set up a Perl script or two to notify me if anything goes wrong by sending an email to my Gmail account. I’ve set up fetchmail to pull emails from my Gmail account via POP3, so all my email is in the process of being backed up on there, and I can use my phone to access it via IMAP, or SSH in and read it with Mutt. Going forwards, I may install Squirrelmail as well to give me more options.</p><p>One thing I’m not too sure about - I couldn’t get incoming mails to work, and I’m unsure whether this is because it’s using a subdomain (the email address is basically matthew@mydomainname.dyndns.org) or Postfix is merely misconfigured. Is it possible to receive emails to a subdomain in this fashion?</p><p>Anyway, this is a really great little machine and it’s been lots of fun getting it set up. I have to say, though, I’m really disappointed with the range of home server and NAS products currently on the market. Most of the NAS systems offer very little in the way of functionality or customisability, and most of the home servers are a bit too big, powerful and expensive, and usually run Windows Home Server, which isn’t really my cup of tea.</p><p>What I’d like to see is a small home server with a couple of hard drive bays at most, and a Debian or Ubuntu-based OS with access to apt-get and tasksel, so it’s easy to install whatever you want from the repositories. Also, give it a web interface that’s simpler than Webmin and makes it quick and easy to set up common software, but offer an advanced option for those that want it. That would be a fantastic device for end users - if it made it easy to set up a UPnP server, a Firefly server, or a BitTorrent client, that would be really useful.</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">13th November 2010 8:20 pm</p><h1><a href="/blog/2010/11/13/a-slight-change/">A Slight Change...</a></h1><p>Just to say I’ve changed the contact form I use on here.

There’s two things in particular that I like about Perl. Once that I really don’t think anyone is going to be surprised by is CPAN. It’s a fantastic resource - there are a huge quantity of Perl modules available for virtually any task under the sun, and they’re incredibly useful.</p><p>The other is just how good the documentation is - I’ve never considered myself to be someone who learns terribly well from Unix man pages, but perldoc seems to have very good documentation indeed, including that for CPAN modules. Also, it helps that if you don’t do well with the man page format, you have the option of running podwebserver and getting the documentation formatted as web pages.</p><p>To give an example, I’m particularly interested in all kinds of network programming, be it web development, IRC, Jabber or whatever, and I’d heard of the Net::IRC module so I decided to start using it to create a simple IRC bot (yes, I know I should really be using POE::Component::IRC instead!). Using the information gleaned from perldoc Net::IRC it was easy to get started writing a bot, and I’ve now come up with the following simple bot:</p><pre><code class="hljs lang-perl"><table><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="1"></td><td><span class="hljs-comment">#!/usr/bin/perl -w</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="2"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="3"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">use</span> strict;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="4"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">use</span> Net::IRC;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="5"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="6"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> $irc = new Net::IRC;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="7"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> $nick = <span class="hljs-string">"mattsbot"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="8"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> $server = <span class="hljs-string">"irc.freenode.net"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="9"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> $channel = <span class="hljs-string">"#botpark"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="10"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> $port = <span class="hljs-number">6667</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="11"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> $ircname = <span class="hljs-string">"My wonderful bot"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="12"></td><td><span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> $owner = <span class="hljs-string">"mattbd"</span>; </td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="13"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="14"></td><td><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">sub</span> <span class="hljs-title">on_connect</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="15"></td><td>{</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="16"></td><td>   <span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> $self = <span class="hljs-keyword">shift</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="17"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="18"></td><td>   <span class="hljs-keyword">print</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Joining $channel\n"</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="19"></td><td>   $self-&gt;<span class="hljs-keyword">join</span>($channel);</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="20"></td><td>   $self-&gt;privmsg($channel,<span class="hljs-string">"Ready to go!"</span>);</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="21"></td><td>}</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="22"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="23"></td><td><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">sub</span> <span class="hljs-title">on_disconnect</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="24"></td><td>{</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="25"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> $self = <span class="hljs-keyword">shift</span>;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="26"></td><td>    $self-&gt;<span class="hljs-keyword">join</span>($channel);</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="27"></td><td>    $self-&gt;privmsg($channel, <span class="hljs-string">"Sorry about that - dropped out for a sec."</span>);</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="28"></td><td>} </td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="29"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="30"></td><td><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">sub</span> <span class="hljs-title">on_join</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="31"></td><td>{</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="32"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-comment"># Get the connection and event objects</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="33"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> ($conn, $event) = @_;</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="34"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="35"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-comment"># Get the nick that just joined</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="36"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> $newnick = $event-&gt;{nick};</td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="37"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="38"></td><td>    <span class="hljs-comment"># Greet the new nick</span></td></tr><tr><td class="linenos" data-pseudo-content="39"></td><td>    $conn-&gt;privmsg($channel, <span class="hljs-string">"Hello, $newnick!

From here, it’s easy to extend the on_public and on_msg subroutines to deal with other messages - for instance, I could use a regular expression to look for “!respond” in the text of the message and if it’s found, respond with any appropriate text.</p><p>I’ve hard-coded the appropriate details into the script in this case to make it quicker and easier to test it, but it would be trivial to change it to either accept settings passed as arguments from the command line, or have it grab these from a separate text file.</p><p>My initial doubts about Perl are really wearing off. It’s a powerful language and one that, now I’ve picked up the basic syntax, I’m having little trouble getting work done with.</p></article></div><div class="col-md-4"><h1>Recent Posts</h1><p><a href="/blog/2016/04/04/writing-faster-laravel-tests/">Writing Faster Laravel Tests</a></p><p><a href="/blog/2016/03/26/building-a-location-aware-web-app-with-geodjango/">Building a Location Aware Web App With Geodjango</a></p><p><a href="/blog/2016/03/18/my-experience-using-php-7-in-production/">My Experience Using PHP 7 in Production</a></p><p><a href="/blog/2016/01/26/mocking-external-apis-in-python/">Mocking External Apis in Python</a></p><p><a href="/blog/2015/11/18/learning-more-about-react-dot-js-and-flux/">Learning More About React.js and Flux</a></p><section id="github-profile"></section><h4>My GitHub repositories</h4><ul id="github-repos"><li>Loading repositories...</li></ul></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><ul class="pager"><li><a href="/posts/11/">Newer</a></li><li><a href="/posts/13/">Older</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class="container footercontainer"><div class="col-md-12"><p class="copyright">Copyright &copy; Matthew Daly 2016.</p></div></div></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/all.min.js"></script><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
