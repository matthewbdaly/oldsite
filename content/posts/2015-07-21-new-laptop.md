For a while now it's been obvious that I needed a new laptop. My main workhorse for a while has been a 2008 MacBook, but I'm not really a fan of Mac OS X and it was stuck on Snow Leopard, so it was somewhat behind the times. It was also painfully slow by modern standards - regenerating this site took a couple of minutes. I had two other reasonably modern laptops, but one was too big and cumbersome, while the other was a Dell Mini, which isn't really fast enough for a developer. When I last bought a laptop, I wasn't even a developer, so it was long past time I got a more suitable machine.

I therefore took the plunge and ordered a new Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, which arrived today. It's an absolutely beautiful machine, and it's extremely light. It's also a *lot* faster than any other machine I own. The screen is exceptionally sharp, and setting it up was nice and easy.

After an hour or so with this machine, I'm already really happy with it. We'll have to see whether I still think so after a few months using it.
