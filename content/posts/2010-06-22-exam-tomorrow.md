Just a short note to say that tomorrow morning I have my CIW JavaScript Fundamentals exam. Hopefully I should be able to pass first time (although I'm not impressed by how inaccurate the practice exams are, and how out of date the training materials are), and should then be able to get on with learning Perl next. I'm looking forward to learning Perl, as it's more the kind of thing I'm interested in than JavaScript is.
