For a while now I've been considering setting up a website on my own domain name, as this would provide an excellent way of showcasing my abilities with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provide a URL I can put on my CV when applying for jobs. I've had my eye on the domain name matthewdaly.co.uk, and last night I bought the bullet and paid for it (bargain at about £6 for 2 years, including VAT).

I've wanted to put a blog on there, but I couldn't find a blogging engine that I could easily integrate into it. I was thinking that the way to go would be to write a custom blogging app using Django, but right now I really don't have time to sit down and learn Django properly, what with doing an unrelated day job and studying in my spare time. So, I thought rather than put it off, I'll get some free web hosting and put something on there now, even if it's fairly basic.

And [here](http://matthewdaly.co.uk) it is! Please feel free to have a play around with it and let me know what you think, or any problems you've had with it. I've used a little CSS3 in making it, partly because it was by far the easiest way to implement drop shadows and rounded corners, but it degrades fairly gracefully in browsers that don't support CSS3 yet. I didn't have too many problems with adjusting for IE6 thanks to the reset style sheet I used, and the [PNG fix](http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/).

In future I will expand upon this fairly basic site (and naturally I'm going to have to stump up for paid hosting in future) but for now this is my first hand-coded website!
