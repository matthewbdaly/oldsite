I've made the tough decision to abandon Blogger and move my blog to Wordpress. For those of you that have joined me from my old blog at [http://farbeyondtheedgeofreason.blogspot.com/](http://farbeyondtheedgeofreason.blogspot.com/) thank you very much for doing so!

The new blog will have a somewhat different emphasis than my old one. Rather than being a bit of a free-for-all covering Linux, programming, new websites and anything else that I think of, this blog is going to be much more focused, with web development as the main subject. That said, we'll have to see how things work out.

I'm considering another move in a few months time, with my site at [http://www.matthewdaly.co.uk/](http://www.matthewdaly.co.uk/) becoming the new location of the blog, but that would require paid hosting, so I'm going to give Wordpress a good try first before I commit to using it.
